	   	<h3>How to protect yourself from attacks</h3>
		<p>
			Personal and sensitive data that users share at home or at work circulate daily on the web. With that in mind, betting on good protection against hackers is one of the biggest concerns of our time.


			Until not so long ago, the concern with the safety of navigation was not that great. However, with systems of large companies being invaded, such as Sony, NASA, FBI and even the system of the Brazilian government, it is common that people have started to feel unprotected and vulnerable.

			Adopting hacker protection techniques is a very important measure that must be constantly monitored. Furthermore, with a small change in habits and the adoption of simple navigation strategies, the user can already do a lot for their security.

			If you are also concerned about the security of your information and want to avoid having your computer invaded by malicious people, today's text is for you.

			We will explain how to adopt effective hacker protection in your routine through some tips that can be put into practice both at home, for personal use, as well as at work, professionally.
		</p>
		<h3>What are hackers?</h3>
		<p>When we talk about the context of cyber attacks, hackers are, simply put, malicious people who take advantage every day of small oversights by other users' users to steal information.

			However, the term is broader and considers not only those who act as cyber criminals, but anyone who is dedicated to computing to the point of discovering new functions for a system that were not originally assigned to him.
			
			Anyway, it's important to be aware that people with this type of ability can easily find holes in systems and break into them if they want to.
			
			On the Internet it is very easy to fall into one of these traps. Clicking on a suspicious email, downloading a file from an unsafe source or believing in exaggerated ads on social media, for example.
			
			All of this can pose a big risk, even if it's apparently harmless.
			
			That's why technologies advance more and more and specific programs appear to ensure that the user is alerted to malicious and suspicious actions on the web.
			</p>
			<h3>Most dangerous types of attacks</h3>
			<p>Criminals use a variety of strategies to successfully infiltrate a system. Below we quote some more common and dangerous examples that need extra attention and care.</p>
			<h4>Phishing</h4>
			<p>Phishing is a type of electronic fraud that allows users to steal important content, such as credit card data and sensitive corporate information.

				In this type of attack, hackers use tactics like instant messaging, for example. The risk is in clicking on them.
				
				That is why it is important to always be aware of the safe way to access the network, not to hastily click on any message and also to have the ability to identify suspicious messages.</p>
			<h4>Malware</h4>
			<p>Malware is still one of the main causes of system security problems. Its category is quite wide and there are several types of it, like viruses, trojans, spyware and ransomware are some of them.

				Basically, malware is a piece of software that has been modified to damage devices, steal data and cause various types of harm to users who have their devices infected.</p>
			<h4>DDoS</h4>	
			<p>DDoS attacks, or distributed denial of service attacks, can be extremely harmful to businesses. Once they reach a system, these attacks can overload corporate servers, directly interfering with the company's productivity and deliverables.

				Although apparently it is a simpler type of attack compared to the most recent and latest generation, when it does not receive proper attention it can lead to the loss of customers due to system unavailability.</p>
			<h4>Criptojacking</h4>
			<p>Cryptojacking is characterized by a hacker who uses someone else's device to secretly mine cryptocurrencies.

				The most common and evolved form of the attack makes the user use websites that exploit the computer so that virtual currencies can be generated.
				
				The machine used as “orange” for the coup may later present hardware problems, as the process is very demanding of the machine, in addition to causing slowdowns and crashes.</p>
			<h3>Hacker Protection Tips</h3>
			<p>Now you know what hackers are and what are the most dangerous means of attack used by them to attack companies' and users' systems. So, let's look at important hacker protection tips that you can adopt to avoid going through any of these situations.</p>
			<h4>1. Have an antivirus</h4>
			<p>Having antivirus software installed on the machine is the first step in taking care of security during web browsing.

				By keeping the program up-to-date with its latest version, it can alert you if you visit a suspicious website or download an untrusted file. With this, it is possible to efficiently avoid some headaches.</p>
			<h4>2. Keep the software updated</h4>
			<p>An outdated machine ends up becoming more vulnerable. To avoid a hacker intrusion, make sure you keep everything up to date as soon as the latest versions come out.</p>
			<h4>3. Use encryption on important emails</h4>
			<p>Emails that are not encrypted can be intercepted by third parties and easily read. For this reason it is important not to exchange sensitive information or important files without first activating this method of protection.

				A good tip for those who don't understand much about cryptography but want to communicate safely is to use automatic services like ProtonMail.</p>
			<h4>4. Use VPN</h4>
			<p>VPN is an essential tool to access a network anonymously and more securely. Especially in the case of free and public connections, where many people access and end up being an ideal environment for criminals, it is very important to protect yourself so that your information is not intercepted.

				Hola, for example, is an efficient and free option.</p>
			<h4>5. Use 2-step verification</h4>
			<p>A simple hacker protection tip is to use 2-step verification, a very common feature in social media, email, and other online account services.

				It is nothing more than an extra protection, in addition to the traditional password, which will be asked to perform more specific actions or even if the service detects some suspicious activity, such as IPs or unusual devices trying to access the account.
				
				It's a simple measure that makes a lot of difference.</p>
			<h4>6. Look for a professional</h4>
			<p>If you don't know how to perform security procedures or don't know how to identify your machine's vulnerabilities, the best solution is to call a professional.

				It will be able to perform a complete assessment and identify security breaches through thorough checks, as well as perform technical measures on the system that will leave you with stronger protection against hackers.</p>

		<h3>Why is there hacking in games?</h3>
		<p>Video games are now the largest entertainment industry in the world. Compared to books, movies, TV and music, it's the most inherently digital medium. While video games are entertainment, gamers often entrust their personal information to game companies just as they do to their workplace, online stores, or even financial institutions. And what do hackers have to gain by targeting video games and their players?</p>
		<h3>Virtual Values</h3>
		<p>Gaming economies essentially provided a precursor to cryptocurrencies. Although the virtual money earned in the game cannot be used in the real world, it is still a commodity with real value to gamers. Accounts with large amounts of coins or access to rare and prestigious in-game items can be worth high prices in the real world. No matter how old the game is, if there's a strong player base, there's value. A moderator (aka Mod Jed) of RuneScape, one of the oldest online games, recently exploited its elevated privileges to steal virtual money from players (45 billion in game coins, equivalent to $100,000 in the real world).

			This also applies to the games themselves. Many games are published, sold and authenticated online on distribution platforms such as Steam, Origin, GOG Galaxy, among others. Gamers often manage all or most of their games through a single account, and longtime users may have libraries of hundreds of games. Steam also allows players to maintain and market additional virtual items such as wallpapers, stickers and game props. There have been cases of hackers stealing these items from Steam inventories as well as entire Origin accounts.</p>
		<h3>Data theft</h3>	
		<p>Most of the time, however, gamers' accounts are the most valuable to hackers and therefore the most targeted. Online and mobile games gather a great deal of data about their users. The more personal the data, the more valuable it is to hackers, and mobile games often track private information such as location, media involvement and even phone calls. In-game transactions and monthly subscriptions to online games mean that financial information is often included in a user's data.</p>
		<h3>The threats facing gamers</h3>
		<p>Regardless of whether a cybercriminal wants to steal an account because of the player character's virtual wealth or because of his real-world data, he has several ways to successfully do so. The methods themselves are no different from those faced by users in any other field, but gamers may experience some unique risk factors and circumstances.</p>
		<h3>Weak authentication</h3>
		<p>Password reuse is a common problem as the gamer often needs to manage accounts from multiple distribution platforms, publishers and games. Each distribution platform (Steam, Origin, etc.) requires an account; some game companies, such as Epic Games and Rockstar, require an account to play games or access social features; most multiplayer online games require a unique password for them. This leaves gamers having to remember and manage dozens of passwords, and older game credentials can easily be forgotten, becoming out of date for years.

			Many games also do half the work for would-be invaders; often, just see another player in the game to find out their username. For example, Battlefield 5 has a competitive mode of up to 64 players, meaning that a single game gives a potential malicious agent up to 63 usernames on which to try common or standard passwords.
			
			Other games will give you access to gamer scores, giving you access to basically all the usernames used in the game or at least the top players, which will be even more valuable.</p>
		<h3>Security flaws in games and websites</h3>
		<p>While there are many ways gamers can fall prey to malicious agents, this does not exempt game companies from liability. Gamers trust secure infrastructures and applications as much as they trust their own abilities to detect a threat. Unfortunately, this is not a responsibility that game companies have always successfully defended.

			In January 2018, a flaw in Fortnite's authentication process was disclosed. The login URL was not validated, leaving it vulnerable to a redirect attack. To make matters worse, the researchers who discovered the flaw also found and compromised an unused and vulnerable subdomain of Epic. Currently, Epic authentication uses social media login. A genuine login request would also be redirected to the compromised subdomain, which would request the user's login credentials, receive the information and send it to the attacker.
			
			Both the genuine user and the attacker would have valid login credentials to access the Fortnite account. The attacker could steal artifacts, any personal information (perhaps even credit card information), as well as buy and steal in-game coins (V-Bucks, which could be sold for real money outside of the game). And all the attacker would need to do is persuade the victim to use the malicious redirect URL to log in, and that's standard social engineering.</p>
		<h3>How gamers can protect themselves</h3>
		<p>The situation is not as bad as it looks. Users are often the weakest point in any security system, but most gamers are digital natives. A certain familiarity with the technology often facilitates users' awareness of how to improve security and data protection. There are several precautions people can take to better protect their accounts from damage. These are some possibilities:</p>
		<h3>password protection</h3>
		<p>Good password practices are just as effective in games as they are elsewhere. Gamers should follow password strength guidelines and consider using pass phrases to aid in memorization and protect against password cracking. A good password manager can also be helpful. Above all, it is important to avoid reusing the same password across multiple accounts, otherwise a compromised Overwatch account could compromise Steam, Origin and even the user's personal email</p>
		<h3>phishing awareness</h3>
		<p>The common phishing tips apply to gamers as much as anyone else. Never click on a link without knowing its destination. Even links sent by friends can be malicious if they come from compromised accounts. Please remember that genuine emails from game providers will not ask for login credentials or personal information. If it's impossible to say that an email is genuine, please contact the game's support team directly and ask. Gamers should beware of "too good to be true" offers. A gamer who offers an apparent bargain may be trying to persuade people to join a phishing scam, and a site that offers unbeatable competitive advantages is likely to be some kind of scam.</p>
		<h3>Malware protection</h3>
		<p>Many gamers are averse to using antivirus software, as they are often seen as performance (speed) reducers. Some antivirus products also tend to give false positives when it comes to games or gaming platforms. Still, it's possible (and definitely advisable) to find a good antivirus that includes “game mode” features to keep performance high and doesn't discourage gamers from staying safe with fake alerts.</p>
		<h3>multifactor authentication</h3>
		<p>Many games and distributors offer two (or more) factor authentication options. This type of authentication must always be enabled, if available. It adds a step to the login process by sending a code to a registered email or phone number. Despite this inconvenience, game companies encourage 2FA to improve account security and some are starting to offer in-game rewards to players who enable it.</p>
		<h3>How game companies can help</h3>
		<p>In most cases, the ultimate responsibility for keeping accounts secure rests with gamers. However, that doesn't mean that developers, publishers and distributors can't - or shouldn't - do something to help their players stay as safe as possible. Here are some steps game companies can take to help maintain a high standard of security:</p>
		<h3>User support and security features</h3>
		<p>Many of the methods gamers can use to protect themselves depend on what the video game company in question makes available. Multifactor authentication is good, but only if the software has a framework for it. It should be supported so that users can quickly lock their accounts if they are compromised, especially if financial information is involved.</p>
		<h3>backend security</h3>
		<p>There are also features that developers can implement without the player's knowledge. Geofencing can be an effective tool for securing user accounts and is already employed in many other areas. Behavioral biometrics may also be an option to consider. Although behavioral biometrics is still in its infancy and is very expensive to implement, games are in a unique position to exploit this technology. A rudimentary form of behavioral biometrics is already employed in cheat detection systems in some games, capable of signaling potential cheaters for game inconsistencies. A small innovation could easily extend this to account security and protection.</p>
		<h3>User knowledge and support</h3>
		<p>There's nothing a company can do, gaming or otherwise, to force its users to be more secure. However, there is no reason not to make the information as accessible and assimilable as possible. An easy-to-access page containing basic security best practices, presented in concise, simple language, would certainly not be asking too much. All known active threats should be highlighted on the home screen or main menu of a game, along with the best way for players to protect themselves.</p>
		<h3>Respect for users' personal data</h3>
		<p>Data is valuable, both to legitimate data processors and to malicious agents who seek to compromise them. Mobile games and social media apps share the same reputation for collecting unnecessary data about their users, which means that any breach results in a much greater loss than it should be. Several games had to be retired with the rise of GDPR, as it would be too expensive to upgrade their data collection systems to comply with the new regulations. Gaming companies, like any organization that collects or stores customer data, should follow security best practices and never collect more data than necessary.

			The video game has a unique kind of duality when it comes to cybersecurity. A gamer is a software user like everyone else. It is subject to the same security risks and threats as any other user. The same security principles are equally effective and important. However, each threat also involves a unique twist, which adds a complication not seen in any other area. Attackers have more options to compromise the security of gamers, who must adapt their practices to respond to this. By knowing which aspects of security are identical and which are different, game companies and their customers can protect themselves and stay safe with a lifestyle that is “just fun” but carries real value with the possibility of real harm .</p>

				<h3> 
					Question 1: Do you use computers in scientific education in an extra-curricular way? (Ex: has a
					YouTube channel)
				</h3>
				<p> 
					Answer: I mostly use computers in education to support the curriculum classes, mainly through
					videos on YouTube. But in some cases, I also use it as an extra-curricular complement.
				</p>
				<h3> 
					Question 2: Do you believe that technology is a fundamental pillar as a teaching and learning
					tool in several areas of knowledge?
				</h3>
				<p> 
					Answer: For sure. Technology allows access to resources and content that enrich the teaching
					and learning process. In my specific area of expertise, the use of computational
					resources, such as simulators and virtualizers, brings teaching possibilities that would
					be very precarious in a classroom without technology.
				</p>
				<h3> 
					Question 3: How to democratize access to technology in order to evolve as a society?
				</h3>
				<p> 
					Answer: Prioritize access to technology as a public policy, through employment for all and
					decent wages, in addition to tax reduction. Every person should be able to have their
					own devices and infrastructure (eg computers, smartphones, internet, etc., in their
					own home), as well as access through institutions such as schools, colleges and
					research centers.

				</p>
				<h3> 
					Question 4: What techniques do you use in your classes to make understanding a subject
					predicted as “complex” something easy? (Dynamic lessons, games, popular tools, for
					example). 
				</h3>
				<p> 
					Answer: I try to use practical activities and simulators in which I present the concepts in a more
					intuitive format. For example, in the topic of information security, when explaining
					about a security control mechanism, such as a firewall, I try to carry out a practical
					implementation to demonstrate common blocks and errors.
				</p>
				<h3> 
					Question 5: Do you have knowledge in information security? If so, tell us how it would be
					possible to make technical knowledge popular within this area.

				</h3>
				<p> 
					Answer: Yes. I believe information security is an issue that interests everyone, as our lives are
					increasingly digital. It is a topic that should be part of the curriculum of any training,
					since our data are in private or governmental databases and are not always adequately
					protected. Furthermore, we are often on the opposite side of having to store and
					manipulate other people's sensitive data. The technical understanding of how security
					mechanisms are applied is not trivial and requires training built on several
					prerequisites, but it is possible to popularize awareness about the risks and
					importance of using security mechanisms. I believe that creating educational materials
					with a more accessible language, such as infographics, booklets, videos,
					documentaries, among others, is the best option. A good example is the CERT.br
					Internet security booklet (https://cartilha.cert.br), which has several issues on
					information security issues for the general public, which can even be used for
					dissemination under the Creative Commons license.
